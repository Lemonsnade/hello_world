# hello_world
my first github repository

Hi guys!

I don not know what is in README.md. Maybe someday I will encounter into it again, remember the date: 2016.7.11.
I know, it is the file to note down the change of the file between the current repository and the [master] one, I think.

I think I am myself to edit the file in my own public repository.
